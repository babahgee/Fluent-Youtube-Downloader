## Motiviation

Users should be able to convert YouTube videos into any audio/video format they wish, without being interrupted by advertisements or any online limitations. They should also have full control over what they would like to download on their computer.

Actively running web applications require users to have a paid subscription to use their services. That should not be a thing.
