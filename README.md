## ðŸš€ About

### Motiviation

Fluent YouTube Downloader is an open-source Windows application that utilizes the FluentUI design language. Its primary function is to convert YouTube videos into media files.

The main objective of this application is to empower users to convert media files seamlessly without being interrupted by online advertisements.

Users should be able to convert YouTube videos into any audio/video format they wish, without being interrupted by advertisements or any online limitations. They should also have full control over what they would like to download on their computer.

Actively running web applications require users to have a paid subscription to use their services. That should not be a thing.

### Custom Fluent design language

Because I had a lot of difficulty implementing Microsoft's own Fluent design language, I created a simple framework myself to imitate the existing framework.

This selfmade framework is inspired by Microsoft's FluentUI framework. You can take a look at their [FluentUI design language documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui).

## ?? Disclaimers

The developer(s) is(are) not responsible for the things the user does. This software is only intended to make downloading YouTube videos easier, and uses open-source third-party software to perform the conversion.
